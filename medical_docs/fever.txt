Fever is a temporary increase in body temperature, often due to an underlying illness such as an infection (bacterial or viral). It is a natural response of the immune system to help fight off pathogens.

Recommended Medicines:
- Paracetamol (acetaminophen) is commonly used to reduce fever.
- Ibuprofen can also be used if there are no contraindications (such as stomach ulcers or certain kidney problems).
- Always follow the dosage instructions on the medication or as advised by a healthcare professional.

What to Do if Fever Does Not Reduce:
- Ensure adequate hydration and rest.
- Use cool compresses to help lower body temperature.
- If the fever persists for more than 3 days, is very high (above 39.4°C or 103°F), or is accompanied by symptoms such as difficulty breathing, persistent vomiting, confusion, seizures, or rash, seek medical attention immediately.
