Cough is a reflex action that helps clear the airways of irritants, mucus, or foreign particles. It is commonly caused by respiratory tract infections (such as the common cold or flu), allergies, asthma, exposure to irritants (like smoke or dust), or underlying medical conditions.

Recommended Medicines:
- Over-the-counter cough suppressants (e.g., dextromethorphan)
- Expectorants (e.g., guaifenesin) to help loosen mucus
- Antihistamines if allergies are the cause
- Throat lozenges and warm fluids for soothing relief

If the cough does not reduce after a week, or is accompanied by symptoms such as high fever, chest pain, difficulty breathing, blood in sputum, or unexplained weight loss, it is important to consult a healthcare professional for further evaluation and treatment.
